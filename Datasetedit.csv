The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.",,,

I have tried to talk to some of her siblings regarding the issue and they don't really want to know or aren't comfortable with the subject and shut down the conversation immediately.

In the past year I have attended a counselor and have found it very beneficial, my only regret is that I didn't have the opportunity or wasn't aware of it's benefits 20+ years ago. Helping people identify and deal with issues they are experiencing would be of huge benefit to an organisation.
